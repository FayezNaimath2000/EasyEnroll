Instructions: 
Simply enter “ruby Scheduler.rb” into the terminal. Make sure the input files are “student_pref.csv” and “course_constraints.csv”

Issues: I was not able to create the 2-d array that would have stored the students in the sections for courses 
that would be in the Course objects. I did not implement what would happen if a student did not get their first, 2nd, or 3rd choices. 
I also did not implement the user input and I hardcoded the csv file names. 
I did not get to the stage where it could generate output files
